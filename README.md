# odin-recipes
Project 1 of the odin project curriculum
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is.
This project is only in html
I will put in practice usin git, github and everything in html foundations learned in the odin project
